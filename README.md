# ZombieGame
A text based game about a zombie apocalypse.

Aaron Jiang:

Used Android Studio to create xml files with the design option. Certain actions were not able to be done with the design feature, so xml edits were also made.
Initially it was just button linking with extention to AppCompactActivity.
It got really repetitive and time consuming, so then a data structure with trees and nodes was implemented.
The each nodes has access to up to 3 nodes, indicating the next text to be displayed.
The current node in the tree is always updated so that the text display would work as well as the option to access the next node.
A parent node will soon be added in.
